A small efficient web framework based on MVC pattern for PHP 5 platform with ease of use and without bloat since it won't depend on any other third party libraries instead it uses anything that PHP offers as much as possible. Also it focuses on clean and compact code base.

  * not all planned features are implemented thus yet unfinished project :)
  * this code was done prior to namespace implementation on PHP therefore it is not using namespace.
